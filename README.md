# Wifi Interrupt Inspector
 Scanning wifi signals if any jammer or brutforce targetted

A python3 software that scans for unprotected wifi networks if any jamming or bruteforce detected

# Disclaimer
This software has been created with the sole purpose of scanning around for free networks. It DOES NOT try to connect any device to said networks. There might be legal consequences if you try to connect to a network without the owner consent, or maybe even to scan around for said networks. Please do your own research. If you decide to perform any of these actions on any network that you don't own, do it at your own risk. Generally it is not legal to scan others networks.
